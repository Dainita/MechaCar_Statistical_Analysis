Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Although this requirement is met for all manufacturing lots in total with a variance of 62.29, Lot #3 exceeds the specification with a variance of 170.29.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### Hypothesis
H<sub>0</sub>: PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

H<sub>a</sub>: PSI across all manufacturing lots is not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
